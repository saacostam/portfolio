        <h4>Tune Code</h4>
        <p>TuneCode is a web programming language for music creation, oriented towards people with experience in the use of software dedicated to music production (DAW: Digital Audio Workstations). Using analogous concepts to DAW's, TuneCode allows the playback of melodies through basic oscillators, the scheduling of samples and the application of effects.</p>
        <p>You can quickly check the functioning of the application by running the previously prepared scripts in the "Load Examples" drop-down menu at the top of the editor. A documentation (in spanish) is also available.</p>
